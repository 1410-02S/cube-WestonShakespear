# The CUBE: multidimensional array assignment

### Running
test-console.bat will build the app and then launch it with some arguments
build-run.bat will build and run the app in interactive mode

### Interaction
To exit enter the "q" command
To shuffle enter the "s" command

### References
I figured there must be some logical way to represent the cube in a matrix. This blog has some cool interactive web apps and some good explanations of the geometry behind the cube and block rotation and displacement.

I'm an Engineering Technology major and wanted to focus mainly on the geometry of the cube. The primary goal was so it could be expanded to any size cube. I think if I was smarter with matrix math it could also be run on a gpu for simulation.
